We have some python files that perform different functions 

"python run_output.py input.txt output.txt" runs our current code on input.txt
and output our result to output.txt (according to the format specified for algobowl) 

"python verify.py input.txt output.txt" tests if the graph in output.txt is a valid result for the given
graph from input.txt. 

These files are a little slow because of the networkx import. However, thats why the jupyter notebook is nice.
